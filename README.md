# Computer Vision Based Cardio

Our project uses computer vision to replace manual keyboard input. By having the user move their body to play the applicable games, our project allows for an engaging workout.

# Our goal
Creating a computer based model allowing users to play their favorite arrow based computer games. These games are intended to be played on the treadmill, engaging the whole body, and giving users motivation to reach cardio goals. While we have a working model of our gameplay, in the future, we intend to create a model which can connect to workout machinery, such as treadmills or step machines, allowing a user to run in real time as though in the game. We would also have methods of connecting this data to health apps, therefore integrating our program as an every day workout tool.

# Our process
We started off brainstorming different ideas for what we could do as a project, bouncing between creating an app that could teach a user ASL, to games like beatsaber, and even a program that could suggest an outfit based on the weather. While we were talking though, we realized our mututal love for brainrot only had one possible solution -- we had to make a platform game runner. Since we had already talked about creating gym tools, we thought that if we could engage the whole body, we could make a solution to an every day problem -- losing the motivation for cardio since all we really want is the gainz. We came to this solution, and quickly started prototyping. (It was not quick). However, using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI on PyCharm, we were able to work on a body mapping program which directly mapped to certain keys on a keyboard, used to control a laptop.
